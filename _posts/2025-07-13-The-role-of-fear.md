I became a self-employed IT consultant because I am a fearful person.

1) I'm afraid of being an employee: being “trapped” in a company I don't like because “job hopping is bad” and “the job market is not so good right now”.
2. but I'm also afraid of fundraising and founding a startup: I don't want to “burn” other people's money.
3) I'm also afraid of founding a larger company because I don't want to burn my own money either.

So I'm actually just super scared of failure. Which is totally crazy, because at the same time I think I'm pretty competent. But I'm just competent in “soft” things that are difficult to measure. And I have no idea how I can turn that into money, except by selling myself.


**But what do I actually want?**

But I actually *want* something completely different: I *want* to build a team. “Build” in the true sense of the word - people should be happier and more “successful” after working with me than before.

At the same time, I want to create “real” value for my customers (or - and this is where it gets crazy - actually the whole world). Preferably make climate change less bad or somehow ensure more respect and emotional health.

But here again, I'm afraid. Fear that it won't be worth it financially and that I won't be able to support my family.

Actually this is totally irrational, because I've always failed “forwards” so far. Every now and then I've even succeeded.


**What is the best way forward?**

Now that the fear has been recognized, I can consciously act against it. I can consciously try small experiments to keep the financial risk low. 
And keep reminding myself that I have to overcome my fears in order to become truly successful.
