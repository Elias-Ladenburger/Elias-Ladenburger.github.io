**My vision: a world in which everyone loves their daily work**

*I had a "eureka" moment today when the scales fell from my eyes about what I've been working on for the last few years. How I came to my vision and what it means*.

I had to get up very early this morning. As I stood in the kitchen preparing my coffee, my mind wandered in a light morning fog. Without knowing exactly how or what or why, I suddenly had the thought: "I don't want people to be unhappy in their working life or to be burdened by it". 

That was exciting to observe in myself. Because this thought made it clearer to me retrospectively why I felt or behaved in a certain way in some situations.

I have therefore decided that this is my "version 1.0". The first raw form of a vision that has been with me latently for years.

As a dual student, I said to my mentor "I want to work with people one day". At the Mercedes Innovation Lab, I dealt with corporate culture in the area of conflict between an industrial group and a software subsidiary and started to look into corporate democracy. After my Master's degree, I wanted to create a great (and productive) working environment for my team members at MERSOR. At The New Health Club, on the other hand, I wanted to make managers more empathetic through psychedelic coaching.

When I finally set up my own business, I founded Curious Minds. And I want to use this to make my vision of a happy (working) world a reality.
